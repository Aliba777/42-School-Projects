A multithreaded fractal renderer.

## Features
* Render different fractals: mandelbrot, julia, burning ship
* Different color schemes
* Smooth and linear coloring

## Compiling and running
Run `make`. An executable will compile. Runs on OS X.

Run it with `./fractol [fractal]`. Possible fractals are: `mandelbrot`, `julia`,
`burningship`, `jcubic`, `mcubic`. Cycle color-schemes with `Shift`. Increase/decrease
maximum iterations with `Left click` and `Right click` on the mouse. Zoom in and out with the
mousewheel. Press `c` to freeze/unfreeze the movements, to zoom in in Julia.
